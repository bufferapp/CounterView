# CounterView
A simple Android counter view for showing edittext character counts. This behaves in the same way as our
[BufferTextInputLayout](https://github.com/bufferapp/BufferTextInputLayout) except that it does not wrap
around an EditText view, allowing you to place it elsewhere within your layout.

The CounterView will display the current count of the input content in the edittext. You need to set the max content length allowed using:

    view_counter.counterMaxLength = someNumberValue

You can customise the color of the counter using the app:counterTextColor attribute.

If the input content exceeds this length, the color of the counter will change. This is defaulted as red, but you can change this using the
app:counterErrorTextColor attribute.

The CounterView has 3 different counter types, you can set this mode using the counterMode property.

### Ascending

    view_counter.counterMode = CounterMode.ASCENDING

or 

    app:counterMode="ascending"

### Descending

    view_counter.counterMode = CounterMode.DESCENDING

or

    app:counterMode="descending"

![Descending counter](art/descending.gif)

### Standard

    view_counter.counterMode = CounterMode.STANDARD
    
or

    app:counterMode="standard"

## Hiding the CounterView

![Hiding the counter](art/display.gif)

In some cases you may wish to hide the CounterView until there are only a certain
number of characters available for the input text. You can set this value using:

    view_counter.charactersRemainingUntilCounterDisplay = someNumberValue

That way, this means that the counter won't be shown until the user is someNumberValue away from the maximum counter length.

## Using the CounterView

You will need to begin by adding the dependency to your project:

    implementation 'org.buffer.android:counter-view:1.0'

Next, as shown in the sample app, can be added to your layout like so:

    <org.buffer.android.counterview.CounterView
            android:id="@+id/view_counter"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            app:counterErrorTextColor="@color/colorAccent"
            app:counterTextColor="@color/colorPrimary" />
            
 You then need to attach the CounterView to the desired edittext using:
 
     view_counter.attachToEditText(view_input)
